Sci-Hub remains a landmark in the push for open access vis-à-vis the rights of intellectual property holders. Although, the practices adopted by Sci-Hub have largely remained controversial, the underlying philosophy is wildly popular – to make literature openly available for all to access. The current model of placing articles behind pay walls has proven to be a major obstacle for researchers across all disciplines. However, particularly in the legal field there is a temporal ambit to most literature. The vast majority of articles are limited to the discourse of the time, with a few noted exceptions. This makes accessing articles in a timely manner a constant endeavor. On one hand there is the legitimate interest of publishers to monetize their content, the authors who may seek to receive renumeration for their article or acknowledgment, and the reader or researcher who may wish to access the literature to further their work. Each stakeholder plays a vital role in this movement.

However, balancing these three stakeholders remains a constant challenge. There are some journals like the <a href="https://law.stanford.edu/stanford-technology-law-review-stlr/" target="blank">Stanford Technology Law Review</a>, which adopts and online only model. This essentially cuts out a significant percentage of the middleman costs. That would only leave the cost of editing and hosting the articles (which has significantly been simplified by virtue of static hosting and small grants). These continue to retain the structure of older law journals, while upgrading workflows to maximize efficiency. The process of typesetting or publishing largely remains the same.

Other journals like the <a href="https://www.stanfordlawreview.org/" target="blank">Stanford Law Review</a>, <a href="https://harvardlawreview.org/" target="blank">Harvard Law Review</a> and <a href="http://nujslawreview.org/" target="blank">NUJS Law Review</a> operate mainly off of the proceeds received from the sales of printed copies. They have for the most part shifted to an open access model, wherein particularly their newer articles are available online instantly. It is not always possible for all journals to adopt this model, as initial investments continue to remain a high. This is also coupled with running costs and the high cost of printing. With dwindling purchases of journals in physical form, most preferred to adopt the usage of soft copies that are far friendlier than their predecessors. Not only are they immediately available, but they are also searchable, accessible to different audience (across geographical, physical, and social barriers) and are highly efficient to produce.

There are currently hundreds of journals that accept articles, which give authors the option of publishing articles in an openly accessible manner by paying a fee to the journal. These fees can quickly add up and result in hundreds of US dollars, something that remains out of the means of most authors. Although, there remain grants and waivers for authors from specified jurisdictions, it fails to address the requirements of most stakeholders in the equation.

There are law journals like those published by Thompson and Reuters, which adopt a middleground to this tussle. They require that authors provide a license to utilize the articles so published, while placing a moratorium on the reproduction of the article within a given time frame. Usually, this limit operates for around a year. Following this time gap users are allowed to publish their work on other platforms and even republish with other journals. It places the power back with the author, who can then choose to use their work as they choose. Although, this may still affect the temporal aspect of the literature, it continues to hold significant value once made openly available in the public domain.

This brings us back to the title of this piece – open access, moratoriums, and pay walls. To decide which model to adopt remains a matter of choice largely between the journal and author. That being said the benefit of having literature openly available is in the eyes of the beholder. Keeping articles behind pay walls renders them largely ineffective. Moratoriums are a viable alternative, albeit a compromise between different stakeholders.

It is our hope to see a greater push towards journals embracing the future of literature and welcoming it, rather than showing it out the door. As always the Legal Repository remains dedicated to this ideal.
